# shino-carousel

### Welcome to my first project on this GitHub.

The project it self is quite simple, is a HTML/CSS3/JavaScript Carousel.

##### I'll update this Readme as I work on the project.

At first the JS will count the childs inside the tag with the ID and create a array of elements to work with.
